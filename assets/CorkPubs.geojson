Then suddenly a customer confronted one member of our group and immediately started questioning him as to why he was \"looking all over the bar\" when clearly he was just taking in his surroundings. This customer\/wannabe bouncer was acting in a bizarre borderline intimidatory manner and the staff there didn't bother intervening. It was early in the night so none of us were drunk at all so there was no excuse for this behaviour. I tried reaching out to the venue just to get an explanation but with no luck.

A couple of friends and I were walking along George's Quay one Friday evening in January of 2024 and as we passed we decided to pop in. There was a traditional music session happening that night so we only had standing room at the bar counter. You can soak up the atmosphere of this bar from anywhere inside and we had a wonderful evening with our friends in Callanan's! The Staff: The staff are very friendly here and the service is very quick. They like a bit of chat too and are a wealth of information if you get talking to them when its quiet. Layout: The layout of the bar is pretty simplistic. There is esentially just one main room with a little snug at the front on the right as you enter. There is a little room at the back of the bar however, it is very small and only has a few tables and chairs. The bar counter is located in the main room at the right hand side and the seating along with tables are mainly along left hand side of the room. The snug like all other snugs can only take 4 or 5 people but if you are lucky to get into it not only will you have your own seperate access to the bar but its probably the best place to sit in the bar in general. Decor: Callanan's is another one of Cork's old timey bars and it is decorated in such fashion too. The walls are lined with timber panelling and there are a couple of pictures dotted along the walls however, the decorating is kepth mostly plain and simple. There are no tvs in this bar which is nice as this bar is where people come for conversation and a few sociables! Pop Up Gaeltacht: I came here once in my college days as a few friends were Irish speakers and they had heard about the Pop Up Gaeltacht that was taking in Callanan's that particular night. It was a brilliant experience to talk and share stories with people who ranged from basic conversation to a fluent grasp of the Irish language and ever since then I have wanted to come back. I asked the bar man when I visited a few weeks ago if the Pop Up Gaeltacht was still going and sure enough it was being held that very night in another pub in Cork city. If you are interested check out PopUpGaeltacht on Instagram or Facebook. Location: Its located on the corner of Mary St. and George's Quay oppiste Parliament Bridge. Overall Opinion: I highly recommend stopping by Callanan's Bar for a pint of Murphy's and Beamish and the pints were flowing the night we were here. If Guinness is more your thing, they have bottles of Guinness that you can order. Apparently a warm bottle of Guinness is a thing so I must give it a try. I would give Callanan's Bar 8.5 out of 10!", "lowest": "Absolutely disgusting place, horrible service, rude staff, definitely wouldn't recommend going to." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.472345203881069, 51.895420247417697 ] } },

The owners and staff are friendly, attentive and most of all welcoming! They have a lovely selection of beer on tap however, I came in for a pint of stout. They serve a delicious pint of Guinness here and I can't imagine that any of the other stouts would be any different! Layout: The layout of the bar is split into two rooms. The first room is in the front and surrounds the bar itself with some seating. The second room has more seating and is to the rear of the premises. There is a small amount of seating out front of the bar which is lovely on a nice sunny day to enjoy a cold drink. Decor: The pub is decorated with memorabilia from Cork City's history through maps and photographs of the people as well as little plaques with historic details, etc. There is an old fire place in the room to the back of the bar. It was the third of June when we visited and it was covered up so I am not sure if it is still in use. Maybe we'll visit again when the weather gets colder and see if the fire place is in use then! I didn't notice any tv other than an old antique tv. The feel of this is a bar is one of a place where people should come for conversation rather than come to watch tv! Overall Opinion: Dennehy's Bar is an old school bar with a timely feel to it! Things feel like they move a little slower here and its wonderful! I highly recommend stopping by Dennehy's Bar for a beautiful pint of Guinness or drink of your choosing and have a good auld chat with friends!", "lowest": "Gone down hill" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.476595346209271, 51.899991551832599 ] } },

We went for family dinner on a Tuesday night and we arrived around 8pm. The male waiter (who seems to be the manager) took us to the table and took our order. Within the 15 mins, we were served with our appetisers, no drinks were brought to the table. Not even a glass of water. We understood that they might be short staffed so we didn‚Äôt make any complaints and finished the appetisers without any drinks. The manager finally brought us the drink at 8:30pm and took away the finished appetisers. We were left ignored from this point onwards. No mains were served to us yet no one were checking if we were okay. I walked up to the waitress who was standing by the entrance of the kitchen checking for our order at around 9pm. Again, we were waiting for further 15 mins without anyone getting back to us regarding the order. I ended up walking up to the kitchen area for the second time and spoke to a different waitress to get the bill. Someone brought two of our mains to the table at the same time without even apologising. At this point, we were all getting very frustrating as we‚Äôve been waiting for an hour since we placed the order. We decided just to pay for the appetisers and drinks and left the restaurant. Bear in mind that, the second waitress who brought us the bill highlighted the issue to the manager and he didn‚Äôt even bother approaching us! He seems to tell her just to give us the bill. We have been to the restaurant several times and always have good impressions. This has now changed and I can‚Äôt believe the LOW standard of services that we received considering the amount of money they charged. I would genuinely go for ZERO star if there‚Äôs an option for it." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.46453410520912, 51.898693940391802 ] } },
